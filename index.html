    <h2>London </h2>
    <p>
        It is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the
        south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded
        by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its
        1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, "London" has also referred to
        the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent
        and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London,a region governed by the Mayor of London and
        the London Assembly.

    <h2> London Geography</h2>
    <p>
        London, also referred to as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top-level subdivision
        covering most of the city's metropolis.The small ancient City of London at its core once comprised the whole
        settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with
        its suburbs, causing "London" to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes.
